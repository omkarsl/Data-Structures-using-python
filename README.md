# Data Structures Using Python

A comprehensive repository implementing a wide range of data structures and algorithms in Python. This project is ideal for learning and reference purposes — whether you're practising for interviews, preparing for coursework, or improving your algorithmic thinking.

---

## 🧠 Overview

This repo showcases the implementation of various **fundamental data structures** (arrays, linked lists, stacks, queues, trees, graphs, heaps) and **algorithms** (sorting, dynamic programming, graph traversal, etc) using Python. It is structured for clarity and ease of understanding.

### Linked Lists  
- Singly linked list implementation  
- Doubly linked list implementation  
- Finding length of a linked list  
- Reversing a linked list  

### Stack  
- Stack implementation

## 🚀 Getting Started

1. Clone the repository:  
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/omkarsl/Data-Structures-using-python.git
Navigate into the project folder:

bash
Copy code
cd Data-Structures-using-python
Choose a folder (e.g., Arrays/) and open the Python files to study or run them.

Run any script using Python 3:

bash
Copy code
python3 some_script.py
(Ensure you have Python 3 installed.)

📚 How to Use the Code
Each folder corresponds to a data structure or algorithm family.

Read the code file comments and docstrings to understand the logic.

Try modifying the input data or writing your own test cases.

Use this repository as a reference or study aid for algorithmic interviews or coursework.

🛠 Technologies Used
Language: Python 3

No external dependencies required for core implementations

Standard library only (unless otherwise noted)

🎯 Why This Project Helps
Provides clear and practical code implementations for many essential data structures and algorithms

Helps you develop strong foundations in algorithmic thinking — beneficial for interviews, academic work, or self-learning

Easily navigable and structured for quick reference

🚧 Future Enhancements
Add unit tests for each module (using unittest or pytest)

Add more advanced algorithms (e.g., network flows, segment trees, suffix arrays)

Provide performance benchmarks and complexity analysis in comments
